ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MJBaker98 and Iâ€™m interested in developing software that will improve the lives of its users.

I am a part-time student and full-time software engineer and aerospace engineer. Iâ€™m currently building full-stack applications using Swift (iOS), Typescript/React, and Python - my main project is an iOS application that will display data regarding stolen wages in New York State. If you are interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out!
